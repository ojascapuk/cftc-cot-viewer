Demystifying the Commitment of Traders report
---------------------------------------------

Types of Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three (3) different *kinds* of reports:

- Traders in Financial Futures (TFF)
- Disaggregated
- Legacy

The most popular and well-known type of report seems to be the Legacy report. The TFF, however, does specify more categories of traders, so in theory it should be more useful data.

Legacy
------

These reports only separate traders into three groups:

* **Commercials**: Commercials are market participants who are primarily engaged in the production, processing, or merchandising of a particular commodity. They are often referred to as "hedgers" because their primary purpose in trading futures contracts is to manage and mitigate the risks associated with their core business activities. Commercials typically include farmers, producers, manufacturers, and other entities with direct exposure to the physical commodity.
* **Non-Commercials**: Non-Commercials represent market participants who are primarily speculative in nature. They are often referred to as "speculators" or "large traders" and include hedge funds, managed money, and other institutional investors. Unlike Commercials, Non-Commercials do not have a direct interest in the physical commodity; instead, they engage in futures trading to profit from price movements.
* **Non-Reportables**: This category aggregates the leftover positions that were from traders not large enough to be required to report. This category is often also called "small specs" or "retail".

All the commodities/financial futures with reporting requirements have a Legacy type report. The oldest data will always be in the Legacy format. The other two formats, TFF and Disaggregated, are slightly newer and offer more information.

From the CFTC::

    The Legacy reports are broken down by exchange. These reports have a futures
    only report and a combined futures and options report. Legacy reports break
    down the reportable open interest positions into two classifications:
    non-commercial and commercial traders.

Disaggregated
-------------

These reports are for physical commodities: agricultural, petroleum and products, natural gas and products, electricity, base metals, precious metals. The Disaggregated reports break down open interest positions into four (4) classifications:

* **Producer/Merchant/Processor/User**: This category includes entities primarily involved in the physical production, processing, or consumption of a commodity. Producer/Merchants are in the futures market for non-speculative reasons. They use futures contracts to hedge against price fluctuations in the underlying commodity, aiming to reduce their risk exposure. These participants provide valuable insights into the fundamental supply and demand dynamics of the commodity market.
* **Swap Dealers**: Swap dealers are financial institutions that deal in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, including swaps and options. In the COT report, they are categorized separately from Commercials. Swap dealers use futures contracts to manage the risk associated with their OTC derivative positions. Monitoring their positions can provide insights into the broader derivatives market's sentiment and risk management strategies.
* **Managed Money**: Managed money refers to large institutional investors, such as hedge funds and commodity trading advisors (CTAs), whose primary focus is on speculative trading. They aim to profit from price movements in commodities and financial markets. The Managed Money category often reflects speculative sentiment and trend-following behavior, making it essential for traders and analysts to gauge market sentiment.
* **Other Reportables**: These are large traders (who must report positions) who do not fit in either of the above categories.
* **Non-Reportables**: Again, these are small traders who do not have to report; "small speculators."

Traders in Financial Futures
----------------------------

The Traders in Financial Futures (TFF) report includes financial contracts, such as currencies, US Treasury securities, Eurodollars, stocks, VIX and Bloomberg commodity index. These reports have a futures only report and a combined futures and options report. The TFF report breaks down the reportable open interest positions into four classifications:

* **Dealer/Intermediary**: This classification includes financial institutions and market intermediaries, such as banks and broker-dealers, which often act as market makers and facilitate trading in financial futures and options. They may take positions to manage risk or to facilitate customer orders. Dealer/Intermediaries play a vital role in maintaining market liquidity.
* **Asset Manager/Institutional**: Asset managers and institutional investors fall into this category. These entities manage large portfolios on behalf of clients, including pension funds, mutual funds, and other investment vehicles. They engage in financial futures and options trading as part of their overall investment strategies, often aiming to hedge risk or capitalize on market opportunities.
* **Leveraged Funds**: Leveraged funds typically refer to hedge funds and other investment funds that use leverage to amplify their trading positions. These entities seek to generate higher returns through speculative trading in financial futures and options markets. Their strategies can range from directional bets on market trends to more complex trading approaches.
* **Other Reportables**: Similar to the "Other Reportables" category in the CFTC Commitment of Traders (COT) report for commodity futures, this category encompasses a diverse range of market participants who don't fit neatly into the other classifications. It can include smaller traders, proprietary trading firms, and various market participants with positions in financial futures and options. This category provides additional context for analyzing market sentiment and participation.

What is the point of tracking this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many investment banks and financial journalists publish charts derived from the COT. It is mostly used for identifying extremes in positioning. For example, one may see Leveraged Funds crowded short in the Euro futures contract, and perhaps one might conclude that they may be wrong and therefore Euro may rise in value.

Large traders are legally required to report to the CFTC and accurately, so this CFTC data may be more useful than third-party secondary sourcse for market positioning.
